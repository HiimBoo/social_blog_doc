# Social Blog App

Now is the best time to learn programming. You can choose from numerous learning resources, reference guides, or tutorials. Once you are familiar with the core principles and syntax, the next step is to build your own web application. However, at this point, the knowledge that you've acquired is fragmented. You've learned pieces of information here and there, but you haven't seen all that information used in one application. And here we are.

This is a documentation of how to create a middle-level web application in MERN stack **from scratch**. We cover every step in detail and walk you through the entire process starting from 0 lines of code and end up a couple of thousand lines of code. In the end, you will have a big example that helps you connect all of your knowledge together, and also hopefully inspires you to build your own app based on this app.

A demo is worth a thousand words: [Demo App](https://social-blog-cs.netlify.app/)
